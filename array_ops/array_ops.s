# Simple array program: make 10 numbers, set them to 0, then add 1 to each

# Register Roles
# x1 - Array Base Address

# Holds the starting memory address of my_array
# Set once with la x1, my_array and never changes
# Think of it as a "pointer to the array"
# x2 - Loop Counter

# Tracks which array element we're currently processing (0, 1, 2... 9)
# Gets incremented with addi x2, x2, 1 each loop iteration
# Reset to 0 when starting the second loop
# x3 - Loop Limit

# Holds the value 10 (array size)
# Used in beq x2, x3, done to check if we've processed all elements
# Constant throughout the program
# x4 - Byte Offset

# Calculated as counter Ã— 4 using slli x4, x2, 2
# Tells us how many bytes from the start of the array to find element[counter]
# Changes each iteration: 0, 4, 8, 12, 16...
# x5 - Element Address

# Calculated as base_address + offset using add x5, x1, x4
# Points to the exact memory location of the current array element
# Used in lw/sw instructions to access that specific element

# ================================================================
# Core logic (just 8 instructions in the loop):
# beq - check if done
# slli - calculate byte offset
# add - calculate element address
# lw - load current value
# addi - add immediate to value
# sw - store value back
# addi - increment counter
# j - jump back to start
# ================================================================

# Shortest way to add 1 to each element in a zero array
