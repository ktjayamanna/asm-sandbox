## üîç GDB Investigation Guide

### Essential GDB Commands

```bash
# Starting a debugging session
gdb ./buggy_arrays
(gdb) break main
(gdb) run

# Setting breakpoints on specific functions
(gdb) break bug_array_bounds
(gdb) break bug_2d_array_access
(gdb) continue

# Examining variables and memory
(gdb) print variable_name
(gdb) print &array[0]
(gdb) print sizeof(array)

# Memory examination (the most powerful tool!)
(gdb) x/8wd &array[0]     # 8 words in decimal
(gdb) x/16xb &array[0]    # 16 bytes in hex
(gdb) x/20cb &string[0]   # 20 characters

# Stepping through code
(gdb) step               # Step into functions
(gdb) next               # Step over functions
(gdb) continue           # Continue to next breakpoint

# Getting information
(gdb) info locals        # Show local variables
(gdb) backtrace         # Show call stack
(gdb) list              # Show source code
```

### Investigation Strategy for Each Challenge

#### Challenge 1: Array Bounds
```gdb
(gdb) break bug_array_bounds
(gdb) run
(gdb) print &scores[0]
(gdb) print &scores[4]
(gdb) print &scores[5]    # What's here?
(gdb) x/8wd &scores[0]    # Examine memory around array
```
**Questions to ask**: What's at scores[5]? Is it valid memory?

#### Challenge 2: 2D Array Access
```gdb
(gdb) break bug_2d_array_access
(gdb) run
(gdb) print &matrix[0][0]
(gdb) print &matrix[1][2]
(gdb) print (int*)matrix + 1 + 2
(gdb) x/12wd &matrix[0][0]  # See entire matrix
```
**Questions to ask**: How are 2D arrays stored? What's the correct address formula?

#### Challenge 3: String Arrays
```gdb
(gdb) break bug_string_arrays
(gdb) run
(gdb) print &names[0][0]
(gdb) print names[0]
(gdb) print (char**)names
(gdb) x/30cb &names[0][0]   # See raw character data
```
**Questions to ask**: What's the difference between char[3][10] and char*[3]?

#### Challenge 4: Buffer Overflow
```gdb
(gdb) break bug_buffer_overflow
(gdb) run
(gdb) print &dest[0]
(gdb) x/60cb &dest[0]      # Before strcpy
(gdb) step                 # Step over strcpy
(gdb) x/60cb &dest[0]      # After strcpy - see the damage!
```
**Questions to ask**: What memory got overwritten? How can you prevent this?

#### Challenge 5: Struct Arrays
```gdb
(gdb) break bug_struct_indexing
(gdb) run
(gdb) print sizeof(Employee)
(gdb) print &employees[0]
(gdb) print &employees[1]
(gdb) print (Employee*)((int*)employees + 2)
(gdb) x/84cb &employees[0]  # See all employee data
```
**Questions to ask**: How big is each Employee? What's wrong with the calculation?

#### Challenge 6: Array Parameters
```gdb
(gdb) break process_array
(gdb) run
(gdb) print sizeof(arr)
(gdb) backtrace
(gdb) frame 1              # Go back to main
(gdb) print sizeof(numbers)
```
**Questions to ask**: Why are the sizeof values different? What is "array decay"?

## üéì Learning Objectives

By completing these challenges, you'll master:

### Core Array Concepts
- **Address calculation formula**: `address = base + (index √ó element_size)`
- **2D array layout**: Row-major storage and proper indexing
- **Array vs pointer differences**: Understanding decay and parameter passing
- **Memory bounds**: Recognizing and preventing buffer overflows
- **Struct alignment**: How padding affects address calculations

### Professional Debugging Skills
- **GDB proficiency**: Breakpoints, memory examination, stepping through code
- **Memory analysis**: Reading hex dumps and understanding layouts
- **Systematic debugging**: Methodical approach to finding bugs
- **Root cause analysis**: Understanding why bugs happen, not just fixing symptoms

### Memory Safety Awareness
- **Buffer overflow detection**: Spotting and preventing memory corruption
- **Bounds checking**: Validating array access patterns
- **Safe coding practices**: Writing memory-safe array code

## ‚úÖ How to Verify Your Fixes

### Testing Your Solutions

1. **Compile and test your fixed code**:
   ```bash
   gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c99 -g -o my_fixed_arrays buggy_arrays.c
   ./my_fixed_arrays
   ```

2. **Expected correct behavior**:
   - **Challenge 1**: Total = 439, Average = 87.80 (exactly 5 scores)
   - **Challenge 2**: Both methods return 7 for matrix[1][2]
   - **Challenge 3**: Prints "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie" without crashing
   - **Challenge 4**: Handles buffer overflow safely (truncation or error)
   - **Challenge 5**: Returns employee Jane (ID=102) correctly
   - **Challenge 6**: Processes all 8 array elements

3. **Run with memory checkers**:
   ```bash
   valgrind --tool=memcheck ./my_fixed_arrays
   ```
   Should show no memory errors or leaks.

### Success Criteria

You've mastered array addressing when you can:
- ‚úÖ Calculate any array element's address manually
- ‚úÖ Predict where pointer arithmetic will point
- ‚úÖ Debug segmentation faults using GDB
- ‚úÖ Explain why each bug caused its specific problem
- ‚úÖ Write memory-safe array code
- ‚úÖ Use GDB effectively for memory investigation

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Commands

```bash
make           # Compile the debugging challenge
make run       # Run the buggy program (see the problems)
make gdb       # Start GDB debugging session ‚≠ê START HERE

make clean     # Remove compiled files
make help      # Show all commands
```

## üí° Pro Tips for Success

### Debugging Methodology
1. **Start with `make gdb`** - Don't just run the program
2. **Set breakpoints strategically** - Break at each challenge function
3. **Examine memory extensively** - Use `x/` commands liberally
4. **Step through line by line** - Don't rush to the end
5. **Compare expected vs actual** - Verify your mental model

### Memory Investigation Techniques
- **Before/after comparisons**: Examine memory before and after operations
- **Address arithmetic**: Manually calculate expected addresses
- **Pattern recognition**: Look for memory corruption patterns
- **Size awareness**: Always check sizeof() values

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't just fix symptoms - understand root causes
- Don't skip the memory examination steps
- Don't assume you know what's wrong - investigate first
- Don't forget to test your fixes thoroughly
